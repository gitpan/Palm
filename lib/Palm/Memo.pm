=head1 NAME

Palm::Memo - Handler for Palm Memo databases.

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 1.014 of
Palm::Memo, released August 2, 2014
as part of Palm version 1.014.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Palm::Memo;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Memo PDB handler is a helper class for the Palm::PDB package. It
parses Memo databases.

=head2 AppInfo block

The AppInfo block begins with standard category support. See
L<Palm::StdAppInfo> for details.

Other fields include:

    $pdb->{appinfo}{sortOrder}

I don't know what this is.

=head2 Sort block

    $pdb->{sort}

This is a scalar, the raw data of the sort block.

=head2 Records

    $record = $pdb->{records}[N]

    $record->{data}

A string, the text of the memo.

=head2 new

  $pdb = new Palm::Memo;

Create a new PDB, initialized with the various Palm::Memo fields
and an empty record list.

Use this method if you're creating a Memo PDB from scratch.

=head2 new_Record

  $record = $pdb->new_Record;

Creates a new Memo record, with blank values for all of the fields.

C<new_Record> does B<not> add the new record to C<$pdb>. For that,
you want C<$pdb-E<gt>append_Record>.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Palm::PDB>

L<Palm::StdAppInfo>

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

Palm::Memo requires no configuration files or environment variables.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None reported.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
