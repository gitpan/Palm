=head1 NAME

Palm::ToDo - Handler for Palm ToDo databases

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 1.014 of
Palm::ToDo, released August 2, 2014
as part of Palm version 1.014.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Palm::ToDo;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The ToDo PDB handler is a helper class for the Palm::PDB package. It
parses ToDo databases.

=head2 AppInfo block

The AppInfo block begins with standard category support. See
L<Palm::StdAppInfo> for details.

Other fields include:

    $pdb->{appinfo}{dirty_appinfo}
    $pdb->{appinfo}{sortOrder}

I don't know what these are.

=head2 Sort block

    $pdb->{sort}

This is a scalar, the raw data of the sort block.

=head2 Records

    $record = $pdb->{records}[N]

    $record->{due_day}
    $record->{due_month}
    $record->{due_year}

The due date of the ToDo item. If the item has no due date, these are
undefined.

    $record->{completed}

This is defined and true iff the item has been completed.

    $record->{priority}

An integer. The priority of the item.

    $record->{description}

A text string. The description of the item.

    $record->{note}

A text string. The note attached to the item. Undefined if the item
has no note.

=head2 new

  $pdb = new Palm::ToDo;

Create a new PDB, initialized with the various Palm::ToDo fields
and an empty record list.

Use this method if you're creating a ToDo PDB from scratch.

=head2 new_Record

  $record = $pdb->new_Record;

Creates a new ToDo record, with blank values for all of the fields.

C<new_Record> does B<not> add the new record to C<$pdb>. For that,
you want C<$pdb-E<gt>append_Record>.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Palm::PDB>

L<Palm::StdAppInfo>

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

Palm::ToDo requires no configuration files or environment variables.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None reported.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

No bugs have been reported.
