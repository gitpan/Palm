=head1 NAME

Palm - Palm OS utility functions

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 1.014 of
Palm, released August 2, 2014
as part of Palm version 1.014.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 palm2epoch

	my @parts = localtime( palm2epoch($palmtime) );

Converts a S<Palm OS> timestamp to a Unix Epoch time. Note, however, that S<Palm OS>
time is in the timezone of the Palm itself while Epoch is defined to be in
the GMT timezone. Further conversion may be necessary.

=head2 epoch2palm

	my $palmtime = epoch2palm( time() );

Converts Unix epoch time to Palm OS time.

=head2 mkpdbname

	$PDB->Write( mkpdbname($PDB->{name}) );

Convert a S<Palm OS> database name to a 7-bit ASCII representation. Native
Palm database names can be found in ISO-8859-1 encoding. This encoding
isn't going to generate the most portable of filenames and, in particular,
ColdSync databases use this representation.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
